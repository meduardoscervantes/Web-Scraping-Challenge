# Web-Scraping-Challenge

## This is the NASA web scraping challenge.

### images
#### This directory contains the images associated with the website. The images I scraped for the website are extremely large and take up a lot of screen space. That is why there is three different images for the website.

### templates
#### This directory contains the index.html code

### README.md
#### Same as file name...

### app.py
#### This .py file contains the flask code to create the website. Inside there is mongoDB logic to pass into the .html file.

### mission_to_mars.ipynb
#### This jupyter notebook contains the testing code for scraping different websites.

### scrape_mars.py
#### This .py file is similar to the notebook, except that the code is further optimized to increase performance.
